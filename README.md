# Secure Door Access System
## Descripton 
This project implements a secure door access system utilizing two ATmega32 microcontrollers communicating via UART polling with **acknowledgment algorithms to prevent UART hardware buffer overflow**. The system leverages various peripherals for user interaction and control, such as keypads for input, LCD displays for feedback, and motors or relays to actuate the door mechanism..
## Technology used
